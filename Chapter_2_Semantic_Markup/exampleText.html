    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk. Lying between copies of <i>Nature</i>. <i>New Scientists</i>. And all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in. was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in the four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

    <p>She had spent the lat ten years in this room. sitting under poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement. Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
